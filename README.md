# Office_Supplies_db
A relational database for a company that sells office supplies. 
The company sells items in three categories: 
    writing supplies (pens, pencils, markers, etc.) 
    paper supplies (copy paper, pads, envelopes, etc.), 
    basic supplies (labels, staplers, paper clips, rubber bands, scissors, etc.). 
Each customer is identified by a unique customer ID number and the database stores the customerâ€™s name, street address, state and ZIP code. 
A customer can place any number of orders with the company; it is common for customers to place more than one order in a single day. 
All prices in the database are tracked in US dollars ($). 
I'm assuming that all customers are located in the United States.
