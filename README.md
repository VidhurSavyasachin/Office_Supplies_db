# Office_Supplies_db
A relational database for a company that sells office supplies. 
The company sells items in three categories: 
    writing supplies (pens, pencils, markers, etc.) 
    paper supplies (copy paper, pads, envelopes, etc.), 
    basic supplies (labels, staplers, paper clips, rubber bands, scissors, etc.). 
Each customer is identified by a unique customer ID number and the database stores the customerâ€™s name, street address, state and ZIP code. 
A customer can place any number of orders with the company; it is common for customers to place more than one order in a single day. 
All prices in the database are tracked in US dollars ($). 
I'm assuming that all customers are located in the United States.




Report:
1. List all items sold by the company, sorted alphabetically by category and the alphabetically by item name.
2. List the names of all customers who bought pens in quantities of 100 or greater in any order.
3. List the names of all customers who bought both envelopes and labels (either in the same order or different orders).
4. List all customers who bought copy paper but did not buy any other item.
5. List the names of the customer (or customers) who spent the greatest dollar amount in a single order.
6. List each category, the name of the customer who has spent the most on items in that category, and the total amount of 
   money that customer spent in that category.
7. List the names of all customers in the 06460 ZIP code that bought both staplers and paper clips in a single order.
8. List the name and ZIP code for all customers who have spent more than $500 (this could be spent over several different 
   orders, not just a single order).
9. List each state and show the amount of money spent by customers in that state, in descending order (from highest to lowest 
   money spent).
10. Show the ZIP code where the largest number of orders were placed (i.e., the highest count of orders placed).
